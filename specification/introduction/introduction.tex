\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This chapter covers the basic concepts that govern development and maintenance of the specification.
The actual specification is contained in the following chapters.

\section{Design principles}

UAVCAN is designed to adhere to the following set of basic principles.

\begin{description}
    \item[Democratic network] --- There will be no master node.
    All nodes in the network will have the same communication rights; there must be no single point of failure.

    \item[Nodes can exchange long payloads] --- Nodes must be provided with a simple way of exchanging large
    data structures that cannot fit into a single transport frame (such as GNSS solutions, 3D vectors, etc.).
    UAVCAN should perform automatic transfer decomposition and reassembly at the protocol level,
    hiding the related complexity from the application.

    \item[Support for redundant interfaces and redundant nodes] --- UAVCAN must be suitable for use in
    applications that require modular redundancy.

    \item[High throughput, low latency communication] --- UAVCAN must be suitable for use in
    hard real-time systems.

    \item[Simple logic, low computational requirements] --- UAVCAN targets a wide variety of embedded systems,
    from high-performance embedded on-board computers for intensive data processing
    (e.g., a high-performance GNU/Linux-powered machine) to extremely resource-constrained microcontrollers.
    The latter imposes severe restrictions on the amount of logic needed to implement the protocol.

    \item[Common high-level functions must be clearly defined] --- UAVCAN defines standard services
    and messages for common high-level functions, such as network discovery, node configuration,
    node software update, node status monitoring (which naturally grows into a vehicle-wide health monitoring),
    network-wide time synchronization, dynamic node ID allocation (a.k.a. plug-and-play node support), etc.

    \item[Open specification and reference implementations] --- The UAVCAN specification is open and
    freely available; the reference implementations are distributed under the terms of the permissive MIT License.
\end{description}

\section{Capabilities}

UAVCAN-based networks can accommodate up to 127 nodes on the same logical bus.

UAVCAN supports up to 65536 message, 256 service, and at least 8 anonymous data types.
Some of these identifiers are reserved for the core standard with 
the rest available for vendor- and application-specific data types.
More information is provided in chapter \ref{sec:application_layer}.

UAVCAN supports at least\footnote{Depending on the transport protocol.} eight distinct communication priority levels,
defined in the section \ref{sec:transfer_prioritization}.
Within each priority level different types of transfers and different data types are
prioritized in a well-defined, deterministic manner.

The list of transport protocols supported by UAVCAN is provided in chapter \ref{sec:transport_layer}.
Non-redundant, doubly-redundant and triply-redundant transports are supported.
More information on the physical layer and standardized physical connectivity options
is provided in the chapter \ref{sec:physical_layer}.

\section{Maintenance of the standard data type set}

The UAVCAN maintainers are charged with advancing the standard data type set based on input from adopters.
This feedback is gathered via the official discussion
forum\footnote{Please refer to \href{http://uavcan.org}{uavcan.org}.}
which is open to the general public.

The set of standard data type definitions\footnote{The Data Structure Description Language (DSDL) and related concepts are described in section \ref{sec:dsdl}.}
is an integral part of the specification, however, there is only a small set of required data types needed to implement the protocol.
A larger set of optional data types are defined to create a standardized data exchange environment
supporting the interoperability of COTS\footnote{Commercial off-the-shelf equipment.} equipment manufactured by different vendors.
See chapter \ref{sec:application_layer} for more information.


Within the same major version, the set of standard data type definitions can be modified only in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A new data type can be added, possibly with a default data type ID,
    as long as the default data type ID doesn't conflict with one of the existing data types.

    \item An existing data type can be modified, as long as its version number is updated accordingly
    and any backward compatibility guarantees are respected.

    \item A major version of an existing data type can be declared deprecated.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Once declared deprecated, the major version will be maintained for at least two more years.
        \item Deprecation will be indicated in the DSDL definition and announced via the discussion forum.
    \end{itemize}

    \item An existing data type can be declared deprecated.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Once declared deprecated, the data type will be maintained for at least two more years.
        After this period its default data type ID may be reused for an incompatible data type.
        \item Deprecation will be indicated in the DSDL definition and announced via the discussion forum.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
