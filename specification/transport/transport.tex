\chapter{Transport layer}\label{sec:transport}

This chapter defines the transport layer of Cyphal.
First, the core abstract concepts are introduced.
Afterwards, they are concretized for each supported underlying transport protocol (e.g., CAN bus);
such concretizations are referred to as \emph{concrete transports}.

When referring to a concrete transport, the notation ``Cyphal/X'' is used,
where \emph{X} is the name of the underlying transport protocol.
For example, ``Cyphal/CAN'' refers to CAN bus.

As the specification is extended to add support for new concrete transports,
some of the generic aspects may be pushed to the concrete sections
if they are found to map poorly onto the newly supported protocols.
Such changes are guaranteed to preserve full backward compatibility of the existing concrete transports.
