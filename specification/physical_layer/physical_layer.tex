\chapter{Physical layer}\label{sec:physical_layer}

This chapter contains the specification of the supported physical layers of UAVCAN,
as well as some related hardware design recommendations.

Following the requirements and recommendations of this chapter will ensure the highest level of
inter-vendor compatibility and allow the developers to avoid many common design pitfalls.

The sections that provide transport-specific physical layer specification
directly correspond to those defined in the chapter \ref{sec:transport_layer}.

% Please keep \clearpage in front of every transport-specific specification to enforce clear separation!

\section{Hardware design recommendations}

This section contains certain generic hardware design recommendations that are agnostic of a particular
physical layer implementation.

\subsection{Non-uniform transport redundancy}\label{sec:phy_non_uniform_transport_redundancy}

Mission critical devices and non-mission critical devices often need to co-exist within the same UAVCAN network.
Non-mission critical devices are likely to be equipped with a non-redundant transport interface,
which can create a situation where multiple devices with different numbers of redundant interfaces
need to be connected to the same network.
In that case, the following rules should be followed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each available bus is assigned a level of importance (primary, secondary, etc.).
    \item All nodes should be connected to the primary bus.
    \item Only nodes with redundant interfaces should be also connected to the non-primary bus/buses.
\end{itemize}

The figure \ref{fig:phy_non_uniform_transport_redundancy} shows a doubly redundant bus transport as an example.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Bus power supply}

The standard UAVCAN physical layers support power distribution between nodes.
Integration of the power distribution functionality with the communication interface
removes the need for a dedicated power distribution network,
which greatly simplifies the system design and reduces the complexity and weight of the wiring harnesses.
Additionally, redundant power supply topologies can be easily implemented on top of redundant communication interfaces.

\subsubsection{Power sinking nodes}

This section applies to nodes that draw power from the network.

Each power input should be protected with an over-current protection circuit (for example, an electronic fuse),
so that a short-circuit or a similar failure of the node does not propagate to the entire bus.

If the node incorporates redundant bus interfaces,
it should prevent direct current flow between power inputs from different interface connectors,
so if one bus suffers a power failure (e.g. a short circuit) it is not propagated to the other buses.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power sourcing nodes}

This section applies to nodes that deliver power to the network.

Similar to the case of bus-powered nodes,
UAVCAN power sources should take into account that one of the redundant interfaces may suffer a
short-circuit or a failure of a similar mode.
Should that happen, the power source should shut down the power supply of the failing bus and continue supplying
the remaining bus interfaces.
