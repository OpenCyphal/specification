% It accepts one mandatory argument which is either a full DSDL type name, e.g. uavcan.node.Heartbeat,
% or a full type name glob expression, e.g., uavcan.node.*.

\section*{Overview}

UAVCAN is an open lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic applications via
robust vehicle bus networks.

Features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic network - no bus master, no single point of failure.
    \item Publish/subscribe and request/response (RPC\footnote{Remote procedure call}) exchange semantics.
    \item Efficient exchange of large data structures with automatic decomposition and reassembly.
    \item Lightweight, deterministic, easy to implement, and easy to validate.
    \item Suitable for deeply embedded, resource constrained, hard real-time systems.
    \item Supports dual and triply modular redundant transports.
    \item Supports high-precision network-wide time synchronization.
    \item The specification and high quality reference implementations in popular programming languages are free,
    open source, and available for commercial use (MIT license).
\end{itemize}
