\subsection{General principles}

\subsubsection{Design goals}

The main design principle behind the serialized representations described in this section is
the maximization of compatibility with native representations used by currently existing and
likely future computer microarchitectures.
The goal is to ensure that the serialized representations defined by DSDL match internal data representations of
modern computers, so that, ideally, a typical system will not have to perform any data conversion whatsoever while
exchanging data over a UAVCAN network.

The implicit truncation and implicit zero extension rules introduced in this section are designed to
facilitate structural subtyping and to enable extensibility of data types while retaining backward compatibility.
This is a conscious trade-off between runtime type checking and long-term stability guarantees.
This model assumes that data type compatibility is determined statically and is not, normally, enforced at runtime.

\subsubsection{Bit and byte ordering}

The smallest atomic data entity is a bit.
Eight bits form one byte;
within the byte, the bits are ordered so that the most significant bit is considered first (0-th index),
and the least significant bit is considered last (7-th index).

Numeric values consisting of multiple bytes are arranged so that the least significant byte is encoded first;
such format is also known as little-endian.

        }_\text{most significant byte}%
    }
    $$

\subsubsection{Implicit padding}

Excepting one edge case reviewed below,
serialized representations of DSDL entities never include implicit data padding.
Unaligned data may lead to suboptimal serialization and deserialization performance;
therefore, the data type designer should manually align elements as necessary to prevent performance degradation.
It is guaranteed, however, that unaligned data cannot result in unspecified or otherwise unexpected behavior
of the data handling routines.
The manual approach to data alignment allows the data type designer to trade-off serialization efficiency
over network bandwidth utilization and data transfer latency as necessary without compromising functional safety.

The exceptional edge case mentioned above when implicit padding is introduced is as follows.
Serialized representations of DSDL entities operate at the bit level,
whereas the transport protocols supported by UAVCAN\footnote{As well as the majority of network protocols in general.}
use bytes as the smallest atomic data element.
The resulting mismatch of the data granularity levels is resolved by
appending the serialized representation of the top-level composite type object with zero (0) bits
until the length of its bit sequence is an integer multiple of eight (8).
The term \emph{top-level object} denotes an object that is not nested inside another DSDL entity.
In other words, padding bits may only be added before a fully constructed serialized representation is
handed over for transmission over the UAVCAN network
(or any other destination which does not support bit-level data granularity).

\subsubsection{Implicit truncation of excessive data}

When a serialized representation is deserialized, implementations shall ignore
any excessive (unused) data remaining upon deserialization\footnote{%
    The presence of unused data should not be considered an error.
}.

As a consequence of the above requirement the transport layer can introduce
additional zero padding bits at the end of a serialized representation
to satisfy data size granularity constraints.
Non-zero padding bits are not allowed\footnote{%
    Because padding bits may be misinterpreted as part of the serialized representation.
}.

\begin{remark}
    Because of implicit truncation a serialized representation constructed from an instance of type $B$ can be
    deserialized into an instance of type $A$ as long as $B$ is a structural subtype of $A$.

    Let $x$ be an instance of data type $B$, which is defined as follows:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        float32 parameter
        float32 variance
    \end{minted}

    Let $A$ be a structural supertype of $B$, being defined as follows:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        float32 parameter
    \end{minted}

    Then the serialized representation of $x$ can be deserialized into an instance of $A$.
    The topic of data type compatibility is explored in detail in section~\ref{sec:dsdl_versioning}.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Implicit zero extension of missing data}

For the purposes of deserialization routines,
the serialized representation of any instance of a data type shall \emph{implicitly} end with an
infinite sequence of bits with a value of zero (0).\footnote{%
    This can be implemented by checking for out-of-bounds access during deserialization and returning zeros
    if an out-of-bounds access is detected. This is where the name ``implicit zero extension rule'' is derived
    from.
}.

Despite this rule, implementations are not allowed to intentionally truncate trailing zeros
upon construction of a serialized representation of an object\footnote{%
    Intentional truncation is prohibited because a future revision of the specification may remove the implicit zero
    extension rule.
    If intentional truncation were allowed, removal of this rule would break backward compatibility.
}.

\begin{remark}
    The implicit zero extension rule enables extension of data types by introducing additional fields
    without breaking backward compatibility with existing deployments.
    The topic of data type compatibility is explored in detail in section~\ref{sec:dsdl_versioning}.

    The following example assumes that the reader is familiar with the variable-length array serialization rules,
    explained in section~\ref{sec:dsdl_serialized_variable_length_array}.

    Let the data type $A$ be defined as follows:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        uint8 scalar
    \end{minted}

    Let $x$ be an instance of $A$, where the value of \verb|scalar| is 4.
    Let the data type $B$ be defined as follows:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        uint8[<256] array
    \end{minted}

    Then the serialized representation of $x$ can be deserialized into an instance of $B$ where the field
    \verb|array| contains a sequence of four zeros: $0, 0, 0, 0$.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Error handling}

Correct UAVCAN types shall have no serialization error states.

A deserialization process may encounter a serialized representation that does not belong to the
set of serialized representations of the data type at hand.
In such case, the invalid serialized representation shall be discarded and the implementation
shall explicitly report its inability to complete the deserialization process for the given input.
Correct UAVCAN types shall have no other deserialization error states.

\subsection{Void types}\label{sec:dsdl_serialized_void}

The serialized representation of a void-typed field attribute is constructed as a sequence of zero bits.
The length of the sequence equals the numeric suffix of the type name.

When a void-typed field attribute is decoded, the values of respective bits are ignored;
in other words, any bit sequence of correct length is a valid serialized representation
of a void-typed field attribute.
This behavior facilitates usage of void fields as placeholders for non-void fields
introduced in newer versions of the data type (section~\ref{sec:dsdl_versioning}).

\begin{remark}
    The following data schema will be serialized as a sequence of three zero bits $000_2$:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        void3
    \end{minted}
    The following bit sequences are valid serialized representations of the schema:
    $000_2$,
    $001_2$,
    $010_2$,
    $011_2$,
    $100_2$,
    $101_2$,
    $110_2$,
    $111_2$.

    Shall the padding field be replaced with a non-void-typed field in a future version of the data type,
    nodes utilizing the newer definition may be able to retain compatibility with nodes using older types,
    since the specification guarantees that padding fields are always initialized with zeros:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        # Version 1.1
        float64 a
        void64
    \end{minted}

    \begin{minted}{python}
        # Version 1.2
        float64 a
        float32 b  # Messages v1.1 will be interpreted such that b = 0.0
        void32
    \end{minted}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Primitive types}

\subsubsection{General principles}

Implementations where native data formats are incompatible with those adopted by UAVCAN shall perform
conversions between the native formats and the corresponding UAVCAN formats during
serialization and deserialization.
Implementations shall avoid or minimize information loss and/or distortion caused by such conversions.

Serialized representations of instances of the primitive type category that are longer than one byte (8 bits)
are constructed as follows.
First, only the least significant bytes that contain the used bits of the value are preserved;
the rest are discarded following the lossy assignment policy selected by the specified cast mode.
Then the bytes are arranged in the least-significant-byte-first order\footnote{Also known as ``little endian''.}.
If the bit width of the value is not an integer multiple of eight (8) then the next value in the type will begin
starting with the next bit in the current byte. If there are no further values then the remaining bits
shall be zero (0).

\begin{remark}
    The value $1110\,1101\,1010_2$ (3802 in base-10) of type \verb|uint12| is encoded as follows.
    The bit sequence is shown in the base-2 system, where bytes (octets) are comma-separated:
    $$
        \overset{\text{byte 0}}{%
            \underbrace{%
                \overset{7}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{6}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{5}{\hugett{0}}
                \overset{4}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{3}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{2}{\hugett{0}}
                \overset{1}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{0}{\hugett{0}}
            }_{\substack{\text{Least significant 8} \\ \text{bits of }3802_{10}}}%
        }%
        \hugett{,}%
        \overset{\text{byte 1}}{%
            \underbrace{
                \overset{7}{\hugett{?}}
                \overset{6}{\hugett{?}}
                \overset{5}{\hugett{?}}
                \overset{4}{\hugett{?}}
            }_{\substack{\text{Next object} \\ \text{or zero} \\ \text{padding bits}}}%
            \underbrace{
                \overset{3}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{2}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{1}{\hugett{1}}
                \overset{0}{\hugett{0}}
            }_{\substack{\text{Most} \\ \text{significant} \\ \text{4 bits of} \\ \text{3802}_{10}}}%
        }
    $$
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Boolean types}\label{sec:dsdl_serialized_bool}

The serialized representation of a value of type \verb|bool| is a single bit.
If the value represents falsity, the value of the bit is zero (0); otherwise, the value of the bit is one (1).

\subsubsection{Unsigned integer types}\label{sec:dsdl_serialized_unsigned_integer}

The serialized representation of an unsigned integer value of length $n$ bits
(which is reflected in the numerical suffix of the data type name)
is constructed as if the number were to be written in base-2 numerical system
with leading zeros preserved so that the total number of binary digits would equal $n$.

\begin{remark}
    The serialized representation of integer 42 of type \verb|uint7| is $0101010_2$.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Signed integer types}

The serialized representation of a non-negative value of a signed integer type is constructed as described
in section~\ref{sec:dsdl_serialized_unsigned_integer}.

The serialized representation of a negative value of a signed integer type is computed by
applying the following transformation:
$$2^n + x$$
where $n$ is the bit length of the serialized representation
(which is reflected in the numerical suffix of the data type name)
and $x$ is the value whose serialized representation is being constructed.
The result of the transformation is a positive number,
whose serialized representation is then constructed as described in section~\ref{sec:dsdl_serialized_unsigned_integer}.

The representation described here is widely known as \emph{two's complement}.

\begin{remark}
    The serialized representation of integer -42 of type \verb|int7| is $1010110_2$.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Floating point types}

The serialized representation of floating point types follows the IEEE 754 series of standards as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|float16| --- IEEE 754 binary16;
    \item \verb|float32| --- IEEE 754 binary32;
    \item \verb|float64| --- IEEE 754 binary64.
\end{itemize}

Implementations that model real numbers using any method other than IEEE 754 shall be able to model
positive infinity, negative infinity, signaling NaN\footnote{%
    Per the IEEE 754 standard, NaN stands for
    ``not-a-number'' -- a set of special bit patterns that represent lack of a meaningful value.
}, and quiet NaN.

\subsection{Array types}

\subsubsection{Fixed-length array types}

Serialized representations of a fixed-length array of $n$ elements of type $T$ and
a sequence of $n$ field attributes of type $T$ are equivalent.

\begin{remark}
    Serialized representations of the following two data schema definitions are equivalent:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        AnyType[3] array
    \end{minted}

    \begin{minted}{python}
        AnyType item_0
        AnyType item_1
        AnyType item_2
    \end{minted}
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Variable-length array types}\label{sec:dsdl_serialized_variable_length_array}

A serialized representation of a variable-length array consists of two segments:
the implicit length field followed by the array elements.

The implicit length field is of an unsigned integer type.
The serialized representation of the implicit length field
is injected in the beginning of the serialized representation of its array.
The bit length of the unsigned integer value is first determined as follows:

$$b=\lceil{}\log_2 (c + 1)\rceil{}$$

where $c$ is the capacity (i.e., the maximum number of elements) of the variable-length array and
$b$ is the minimum number of bits needed to encode $c$ as an unsigned integer. An additional transformation
of $b$ ensures byte alignment of this implicit field when serialized\footnote{Future updates to the specification
may allow this second step to be modified but the default action will always be to byte-align the implicit
length field.}:

$$2^{\lceil{}\log_2 (\text{max}(8, b))\rceil{}}$$

The number of elements $n$ contained in the variable-length array is encoded
in the serialized representation of the implicit length field
as described in section~\ref{sec:dsdl_serialized_unsigned_integer}.
By definition, $n \leq c$; therefore, bit sequences where the implicit length field contains values
greater than $c$ do not belong to the set of serialized representations of the array.

The rest of the serialized representation is constructed as if the variable-length array was
a fixed-length array of $n$ elements.

\begin{remark}
    Datatype authors must take into account that dynamic arrays with a capacity of $\leq{}255$ elements will
    consume an additional 8-bits of the serialized representation (where a capacity of $\leq 65535$ will consume 16-bits and so on).
    For example:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        uint8 first
        uint8[<=6] second              # The implicit length field is 8 bits wide
        @assert _offset_.max / 8 <= 7  # This would fail.
    \end{minted}

    In the above example the author attempted to fit the message into a single Classic CAN frame but
    did not account for the implicit length field. The correct version would be:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        uint8 first
        uint8[<=5] second              # The implicit length field is 8 bits wide
        @assert _offset_.max / 8 <= 7  # This would pass.
    \end{minted}

    If the array contained three elements, the resulting set of its serialized representations would
    be equivalent to that of the following definition:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        uint8 first
        uint8 implicit_length_field  # Set to 3, because the array contains three elements
        uint8 item_0
        uint8 item_1
        uint8 item_2
    \end{minted}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Composite types}

As explained in the section~\ref{sec:dsdl_composite_types}, a data type of the service kind contains
two data schema definitions: one for the request object and one for the response object.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise, any reference to serialized representations of a service type
implies either or both of its data schema definitions, depending on context.

A serialized representation of an object of a composite type is a sequence of serialized representations of
its field attribute values joined into a bit sequence.
The ordering of the serialized representations of the field attribute values follows the order
of field attribute declaration.

\begin{remark}
    Consider the following data schema definition,
    where the fields are assigned runtime values shown in the comments:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        #                          decimal           bit sequence   comment
        truncated uint12 first   # +48858     1011_1110_1101_1010   overflow, MSB truncated
        saturated  int3  second  #     -1                     111   two's complement
        saturated  int4  third   #     -5                    1011   two's complement
        saturated  int2  fourth  #     -1                      11   two's complement
        truncated uint4  fifth   #   +136               1000_1000   overflow, MSB truncated
    \end{minted}

    It can be seen that the bit layout is rather complicated because the field boundaries do not align with byte
    boundaries, which makes it a good case study.
    The resulting serialized byte sequence is shown below in the base-2 system,
    where bytes (octets) are comma-separated:
    $$
        \overbrace{\hugett{11011010,1110}}^{\texttt{first}}%
        \underbrace{\hugett{111}}_{\texttt{second}}%
        \overbrace{\hugett{1,011}}^{\texttt{third}}%
        \underbrace{\hugett{11}}_{\texttt{fourth}}%
        \overbrace{\hugett{100,0}}^{\texttt{fifth}}%
        \underbrace{\hugett{???????}}_{\substack{\text{Next object or} \\ \text{zero padding bits}}}
    $$
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Tagged unions}

Similar to variable-length arrays, a serialized representation of a tagged union consists of two segments:
the implicit \emph{union tag} value followed by the selected field attribute value.

The implicit union tag is an unsigned integer value whose serialized representation
is implicitly injected in the beginning of the serialized representation of its tagged union.
The bit length of the implicit union tag is determined as follows:
$$\lceil{}\log_2 n\rceil{}$$
where $n$ is the number of field attributes in the union, $n \geq 2$.

Each of the tagged union field attributes is assigned an index according to the order of their definition;
the order follows that of the DSDL statements (see section~\ref{sec:dsdl_grammar} on statement ordering).
The first defined field attribute is assigned the index 0 (zero),
the index of each following field attribute is incremented by one.

The index of the field attribute whose value is currently held by the tagged union is encoded
in the serialized representation of the implicit union tag as described in section
\ref{sec:dsdl_serialized_unsigned_integer}.
By definition, $i < n$, where $i$ is the index of the current field attribute;
therefore, bit sequences where the implicit union tag field contains values
that are greater than or equal $n$ do not belong to the set of serialized representations of the tagged union.

The serialized representation of the implicit union tag is immediately followed by
the serialized representation of the currently selected field attribute value.

\begin{remark}
    Consider the following example:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        @union           # In this case, the implicit union tag is 2 bit wide
        uint16 FOO = 42  # A regular constant attribute
        uint16 a         # Field index 0
        uint8 b          # Field index 1
        uint32 BAR = 42  # Another regular constant attribute
        float64 c        # Field index 2
    \end{minted}

    In order to encode the field \verb|b|, the implicit union tag shall be assigned the value 1.
    The following data schema will have an identical layout:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        uint2 implicit_union_tag  # Set to 1
        uint8 b                   # The actual value
    \end{minted}

    Suppose that the value of \verb|b| is 7.
    The resulting serialized representation is shown below in the base-2 system:
    $$%
    \underbrace{\hugett{01}}_{\substack{\text{union} \\ \text{tag}}}%
    \underbrace{\hugett{00000111}}_{\text{field }\texttt{b}}%
    $$

    It is recommended to manually align tagged unions when they are nested into outer objects by
    prepending them with a padding field attribute so that the value contained in the union is byte-aligned
    after the tag, as that facilitates more efficient serialization and deserialization.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    Let the following data type be defined under the short name \verb|Empty| and version 1.0:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        # Empty. The only valid serialized representation is an empty bit sequence.
    \end{minted}

    Consider the following union schema definition:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        @union
        Empty.1.0 none
        AnyType.1.0 some
    \end{minted}

    The set of serialized representations of the union schema definition given above is equivalent to
    that of the following variable-length array:

    \begin{minted}{python}
        AnyType.1.0[<=1] maybe_some
    \end{minted}
\end{remark}
