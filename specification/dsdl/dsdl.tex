\chapter{Data structure description language}\label{sec:dsdl}

The data structure description language, or \emph{DSDL}, is a simple domain-specific language designed for
defining composite data types.
The defined data types are used for exchanging data between Cyphal nodes via one of the standard Cyphal
transport protocols\footnote{The standard transport protocols are documented in chapter~\ref{sec:transport}.
Cyphal doesn't prohibit users from defining their own application-specific transports as well,
although users doing that are likely to encounter compatibility issues and possibly a suboptimal
performance of the protocol.}.
