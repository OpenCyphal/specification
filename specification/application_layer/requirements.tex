\section{Application-level requirements}\label{sec:application_level_requirements}

This section describes a set of high-level rules that must be obeyed by all UAVCAN implementations.

\subsection{Port identifier distribution}

An overview of related concepts is provided in chapter \ref{sec:basic_concepts}.

The subject and service identifier values are segregated into three ranges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item unregulated port identifiers that can be freely chosen by users and integrators (both fixed and non-fixed);
    \item regulated fixed identifiers for non-standard data type definitions
that are assigned by the UAVCAN maintainers for publicly released data types;
    \item regulated identifiers of the standard data types that are an integral part of the UAVCAN specification.
\end{itemize}

More information on the subject of data type regulation is provided in section
\ref{sec:basic_concepts_data_type_regulation}.

The ranges are summarized in the table \ref{table:application_port_id_distribution}.
Unused gaps are reserved for future expansion of adjacent ranges.

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Port identifier distribution}{|l l X|}\label{table:application_port_id_distribution}
    Subject-ID          & Service-ID        & Purpose \\
    $[0, 24575]$        & $[0, 127]$        & Unregulated identifiers (both fixed and non-fixed). \\
    $[28672, 29695]$    & $[256, 319]$      & Non-standard fixed regulated identifiers (i.e., vendor-specific). \\
    $[31744, 32767]$    & $[384, 511]$      & Standard fixed regulated identifiers. \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

\subsection{Standard namespace}

An overview of related concepts is provided in chapter \ref{sec:dsdl}.

This specification defines a set of standard regulated DSDL data types located under
the root namespace named ``\verb"uavcan"'' (section~\ref{sec:list_of_standard_data_types}).

Vendor-specific, user-specific, or any other data types not defined by this specification
must not be defined inside the standard root namespace\footnote{Custom data type definitions shall be located
inside vendor-specific or user-specific namespaces instead.}.
