\section*{Overview}

Cyphal is an open technology for real-time intravehicular distributed computing and communication based on
modern networking standards (Ethernet, CAN FD, etc.).
It was created to address the challenge of on-board deterministic computing and data distribution in
next-generation intelligent vehicles: manned and unmanned aircraft, spacecraft, robots, and cars.

Features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic network -- no bus master, no single point of failure.
    \item Publish/subscribe and request/response (RPC\footnote{Remote procedure call.}) com\-mu\-ni\-ca\-tion semantics.
    \item Efficient exchange of large data structures with automatic decomposition and reassembly.
    \item Lightweight, deterministic, easy to implement, and easy to validate.
    \item Suitable for deeply embedded, resource constrained, hard real-time systems.
    \item Supports dual and triply modular redundant transports.
    \item Supports high-precision network-wide time syn\-chro\-ni\-za\-tion.
    \item Provides rich data type and interface abstractions -- an interface description language is a core part of
    the technology which allows deeply embedded sub-systems to interface with higher-level systems directly and
    in a maintainable manner while enabling simulation and functional testing.
    \item The specification and high quality reference implementations in popular programming languages are free,
    open source, and available for commercial use under the permissive MIT license.
\end{itemize}
